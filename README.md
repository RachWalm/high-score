## Planning

Timescale - E-mail containing interview date and task sent to me late Thursday and read on Friday morning. Interview was set for Tuesday, with time required for review of my work before interview. This gave me the timescale.

Initially I was missing the scores.json file mentioned in the pdf. This was requested and provided by Alice Eadle by email on Friday morning.

The request states that it is a python technical test or my first instinct would have been to use Javascript in this instance (although once I saw the JSON file it was larger than I expected to put into local storage). For data analysis I normally would prefer python, but Javascript could be used for quick interactivity between the data and web page.

### Task copied from request

Using the json data provided, build a web application that has the capability to:
- Load, process and store the json data in the system
- Calculate the leaderboard rankings based on the rules defined above
- Display the top leaderboard users on a webpage


The data that is required in the leaderboard copied from request

- Users are ranked by the sum of their best submission scores
- For each user, only scores from their best 24 submissions count
- A user must have at least 3 submissions to appear in the rankings

### Backend

This is a python technical test so python language must be used. Therefore, the data processing will be done on the back end based on python. I am familiar with Flask therefore will use Flask for routing. I could use Django but would take longer and for this simple page isn't necessary.

### FrontEnd

As a limited amount of time is available, it seems reasonable that a simple webpage will suffice. User accounts or confidentiality seems excessive as logically you want to display the top scores for everyone to see. Therefore, using just HTML and CSS initially. 

If interactivity is later decided upon (rather than just a display) JavaScript can be used. But this will be time dependent when calculated data is displayed.

### Storage

As the information in this example isn't going to be updated etc and is already stored in a JSON file, variable storage should be sufficient. Connecting to a database or an input is unnecessary/not requested.

### Design decisions

1. Docker containers, user accounts and security for the app is not requested so assumed not required. I am aware of Docker and know it would make it easier to run from machine to machine, but I haven't ever used it to build an image etc. with the restricted timescale this won't be included in the project. I have Docker installed on my machine and a course downloaded but haven't started it yet.
2. As it is a single page app I am not going to use a base.html to have a standardised format for the headings and footers etc across the site.
3. The rules provided to calculate the leaderboard needed to be done in reverse order for efficiency of the code. Each step would lead to a new list so that the original data wasn't compromised, with the new list being smaller and simpler than the previous so the processing reduces.
Therefore the anticipated processing that needs to be done per function:
- remove any users from the list that had less than 3 submissions which would provide a shorter list. This reduced the amount of data that we are processing in future steps. 
- reorder the "submissions" with largest first so that it could be cut at 24 submissions. Check which ones had more than 24 submissions from the original data so that testing can look at those.
- sum the submissions keeping them attached to the person who submitted the submission.
- display it on an HTML page using decorators for routing in Flask.

##  Development process

Didn't originally have the JSON file, so started with the set up of the front end as didn't want to write algorithm for different named variables.

Set up flask and the routing to produce a HTML page with "hello world!". The function to do this finally became:

```py
# Use decorators for routing
    @app.route("/")
    def index():
        # Load scores to web page using sum_rank value
        return render_template("index.html", sum_rank=sum_rank)
```

Then I got the data and wanted to get that processed as the top priority, as it was more important to get the data processed than have a pretty website with nothing on it. I could use a website I know that outputs python visibly if I ran out of time.

### Questions and responses

#### Questions

1. The task is to provide the SUM of the best submission scores. Without background knowledge of the submissions it seems to me that the data of the sum may not be the best representation (it depends what is intended to be achieved). With the sum coming from between 3 and 24 submissions and no indication of how many submissions it could be misleading data. It could be 3 large submission or 24 tiny submissions. Would an average or indication of number of submission be valuable data for this leaderboard. In a real-life situation I would ask the aim of the board to ensure that the displayed data was valuable, not just what was asked for.
2. For submission can I provide links? Is a github repository link with a README.md adequate for the text of the code and a description of the code/my reasoning/choices? Does the submitted website need to be deployed or just able to run locally? What would be the ideal format for submission? And second best if I can't achieve that?
3. I would assume that priorities would be: firstly functionality and usability, then ease of use, then things like responsiveness and how it looks. Do you have a different order or priorities?

#### Responses

1. That is a good question that I am happy you asked. If you want to include some weighting or some visual hint to help with that problem and make it clearer in the UI, definitely do so. Or equally if you just provide a description of what else you would do, that is also perfectly valid.
2. To be honest this is actually part of the test, to see if people consider it. So yes, a Git repository (gihtub link or equivalent) that contains all someone needs to understand and assess your work is enough. 
In terms of deploying it, you donâ€™t need to do that but also feel free to do so if you wish and you think it would add a benefit. -  Like above, putting some thought into how you would do it  (or some notes in the repository with options/ideas) so we can discuss it in the interview would be good.
3. For that one, what I am looking for is people making a decision on priorities and what is worth doing vs not, then being able to justifying either in some documentation or in the interview later.

#### Set up

A github repository was set up and will be committed to regularly.

I had the python connected to a web page. Data features then processing was the priority.

#### Data

The data was looked at manually. The important factors are:

The original list had 500 entries (len(score_list)).

The data contained some entries that had less than 3 submissions and some greater than 24 so these could be used to test the functionality for those rules. The highest and lowest score could be used to test the calculation.

This means that the functionality to filter out the less than 3 submissions and remove the lowest submission for the over 24 submissions would be necessary (although would have been coded even if not - as other data sets might have them).

#### Get data into run.py

The data was save in VSCode file system /data/scores.json

To allow it to be used for processing it was loaded by:

```py
# Gets all the data from the JSON file
def load_scores():
    with open('data/scores.json') as score_file:
        return json.load(score_file)
```

#### Process the data

Wrote a "main()" app which had a variable to store the returned value from each function. Although we are summing the values as stated in the rules it seemed sensible to make each function modular so the function could be used for other things such as averages or top submission by writing the relevant code and inputting the variable from the stage of the program that was appropriate.

This would also mean if there was plenty of time left over I could do some of the outputs that I thought might be valuable - average / weighting rather than sum.

As per design the first step was to remove the many with under 3 submissions so that we are processing less data. The original list had 500 entries, but once the list had removed all submissions of less than 3 the new list only contained 246 entries, which would require less processing to do the other calculations.

Then had the idea to remove all the additional unused data (name and date from within submission nested dictionary). This would again reduce the size of the data and limit processing and functions having to work round the data that wasn't going to be displayed.

```py
# removes data with less than 3 submissions and irrelevant information on submission name and date
def remove_irrelevant(all_scores):
    # variable to output data
    above_three = {}
    # iterates through data
    for score in all_scores:
        # doesn't process anything with less three submissions to remove all less than three submissions
        if len(score["submissions"]) >= 3:
            # variables
            name = score["name"]
            subs = score["submissions"]
            results = []
            # collects submission scores
            for sub in subs:
                result = sub["score"]
                results.append(result)
                # for development to determine people with more than 24 submissions (remove in deployed)
                # if len(results) >24:
                #     print(name)
            # creates a dictionary with only relevant data and more than 3 submissions
            above_three.update({name: results})
    return above_three
```

As the process of producing this code is of interest to the reader: I have left in the code I used to delve through the data / consider the data that had submissions greater than 24, as that data would require only top submissions being used in the calculation (but it is commented out). This allowed me to anticipate what difference the future removal of lowest scores function would make to the data.

Next function was to have narrow down the data to just taking the top 24 submissions. 

```py
def process_twentyfour_submissions(name_and_scores):
    # comprehension to return user and the scores are sorted highest to lowest and cut at 24 entries
    valid_users = {name: sorted(scores, reverse=True)[:24] for name, scores in name_and_scores.items()}
    return valid_users
```

This used comprehension. The input variable by this point was the person and all the scores. I realised afterwards when looking back at the data that it could be confusing that I had used the word "name" in variables to signify the person which was also the word used for the key for some of the nested data. If I had noticed this earlier I would have changed it.

The function takes each {key: value} pair as name_and_scores.items() and considers the key = name and the value = score. It then outputs name: and a processed set of numbers which is sorted with highest first (sorted reverse = True). It then cuts it at using indexes [:24] which allows only the highest scores to remain. As it is sorted and cuts the end it drops the lowest values.

The next function needs to calculate the sum of integers in the value section. So iterates over the scores and adds them together.

Allowed_sum_total() function turned it into a list. A dictionary would be much easier to organise and display.

```py
def allowed_sum_totals(submissions):
    # comprehension to return user and sum of scores
    sums = {name: sum(submission) for name, submission in submissions.items()}
    return sums
```

Now it needed to be ranked.

```py
def ranking(unordered):
    # using lambda function to select the value rather than key for sorting and reverse give highest first
    ordered = sorted(unordered.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return ordered
```

I wanted the data as a dictionary so converted to a dictionary and removed the extra punctuation. NOTE : python dictionaries before version 3.7 are not ordered so this will break if a lower version of python is used.

```py
def to_dict(lsts):
    #create empty dictionary
    result_dict = {}
    for lst in lsts:
        # for that individual entry take key, turn to string and remove extra punctuation
        keys = str(lst[::2])[2:-3]
        # for that individual entry take value, turn to string and remove extra punctuation
        values = str(lst[1::2])[1:-2]
        # add to dictionary to be output
        result_dict[keys] = values
    return result_dict
```

Flask allows you to pass data to the website so the result was passed to index.html using the decorator routing.

#### Website

The HTML was then written using a "for" loop to generate the table with the data in it.

The CSS was added to make the site more user appealing and readable. Google fonts used to adjust the fonts and the background image was taken from freepiks.

The [background](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/flat-silver-stars-background_35106367.htm#fromView=search&page=1&position=32&uuid=826f9658-da69-4c65-b21c-94ad61531a03) image was from freepiks.

I had a small amount of time to get something productive done so set up responsiveness with media queries. Setting up bootstrap would have taken me too long compared to css for a single page. I thought that css responsiveness was something that would add value that I could quickly do with the time I had left.

#### Testing

- Checked that when the users that had less than 3 submissions function had run that it had changed from a dictionary of length 500 to a length of 246.

- Checked that the value of the sum scores went down in order

- Manually calculated the top ranked user with a calculator and got a total score once the lowest submissions (30 total submissions) had been removed found a summed score of 4025 which matched what was displayed on the website.

- Manually calculated the lowest ranked user (3 submissions) summed score of 73 which matched what was displayed on the website. 

## Final thoughts

### Learnings

First time that I have done data processing and passed it to a website using Flask for the routing. Great learning experience. I did play around with trying to get the data to Javascript so that I could set up buttons if there was time that gave different outputs. My Javascript attempts were not successful.

I expected once I had finished studying that I would be mostly working with Django, React and Bootstrap for coding, but for a small project like this those frameworks would be more work. However, I have used them on bigger projects as it is great for scaling. I had never considered how scale mattered.

### Difficulties/ Things I would work on with more time

Main bugs were jumping back and forth from lists and dictionaries and picking the wrong data when selecting things from nested dictionaries.

I was over ambitious with my suggestions of extra work. To do averages or weighting I would use additional libraries such as statistics.mean() module or Numpy or SciPy or Pandas. 
To deploy I would put it on to Heroku as the only places I have deployed to are Heroku and Git. Git can only take static pages so the calculations in python wouldn't work.

A bit problem I notices just before the end is the output doesn't take account if they are the same score. I did start a function but ran out of time to complete it to put two people's achievement on the same line.

```py
def two_people_one_value (people_and_scores):
    people_and_score = people_and_scores.copy()
    unique_score = {}
    first = 0
    for person, score in people_and_score.items():
        first = 1
        for people, scores in people_and_score.items():
            first = 2
            if (score == scores) and (person != people):
                key = str(person) + " and " + str(people)
                unique_score[key] = score
                first = 3
                print(first)
            elif score != scores:
                unique_score[people] = scores
    return unique_score
```

Unfortunately this gave me a variety of the two names over four lines instead, I tried pop and delete but without success. It may need to be processed in a different part of the function than I was attempting.

![multiple](/static/document/multiple.png)

As this was a last thing I was doing and time was running out, I put this function on hold. Hopefully to be a learning experience for the future. Although it is possible that as I was using the browser for the output and refreshing, the data was changing but potentially a hard refresh might have cleared anything that was making the changes not show.

Javascript would allow us to do weighting in different tables by clicking buttons. Some time was spent attempting to get the data into a variable in JavaScript but I couldn't figure it out and was going in circles so decided to work on features with more potential of success. I have never attempted to use flask and Javascript together before. Although I am sure that there is an easy way to do it, the only way that I could see would be to write the output of the python functions to another JSON file and then load and store that in a variable in JavaScript. I have to assume that the scores would be updating regularly and lots of JSON files for one set of tables didn't seem like an effective way to proceed.

Pagination would have meant that it wasn't just one huge list loading at once. So this is definitely something that I would set up for user ease.

Tables for averages and weighting, and tables for top 10 or top 3, I believe might have been of interest to the user and could have been done with a function in python for the averages and weighting or top 3 and top 10 with local storage and Javascript buttons to switch between them. But as I didn't manage to figure out the Javascript side of things this was left.

Enter score updates is not available. It would need a new JSON file each time for the way that it is set up at the moment. But as updates was not part of the specification I have not looked into that. I am sure it is an essential feature though.
